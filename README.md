# micro-mood-timeline
A real-time micro-mood tracking app built with Vite + React, featuring SSR, streaming rendering, optimistic updates, and a dynamic animated mood-flow timeline.

Micro-Mood Flow is an innovative, minimal, and real-time micro-mood tracker built with Vite + React, designed to capture small emotional check-ins throughout the day.
Instead of using traditional charts, the app visualizes mood changes through a live animated flow timeline that evolves as the user logs new micro-moods.

The project demonstrates advanced front-end engineering techniques, including:
-React SSR / Streaming Rendering (React 18)
-Server Components (where beneficial)
-Optimistic UI updates
-Real-time communication (WebSockets or SSE)
-Feature-based architecture
-Custom hooks for mood syncing & timeline animation
-Lazy-loaded components + Suspense boundaries
-Client cache with React Query or Zustand
-Clean, minimal UI with smooth micro-animations
